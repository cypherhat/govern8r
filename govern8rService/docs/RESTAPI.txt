Digital Notary: Design Details (REST API)
(ToDO: Error Handling)

Client side, we use 'requests' to invoke the REST API. Server side we'll use 'FlaskAPI' to build a REST service for the following:


We could do single sign-on, or not. If we did SSO, we need to return a session id on successful authentication. For the intial pass, we will authenticate each time. This means that we have to GET a challenge and POST the signed challenge each time... (Discussion here...)


RESOURCE: /govern8r/api/v1/pubkey (GET)

Response: 
{ 
	govern8r_pubkey: "" ## the pubkey for govern8r
}

Here is our homegrown protocol for doing secure json over http. Raju please check this!!!

Client to Server:

	1. Create json payload: 
		payload = {....} 
	2. Encrypt payload with govern8r's public key: 
		ciphertext = encrypt(payload, govern8r_pubkey)
	3. Sign encrypted payload with client's private key: 
		signature = sign(ciphertext, client_privkey)
	4. Create payload with signature and ciphertext:
		payload = 
		{
			signature: "", ##  the signature from step 3
			message: "" ## the ciphertext from step 2
		}
	5. Send this as the REST request payload.
	6. Server will verify the message with the signature and if valid, then the server will decrypt it using its private key:
		if (verify(payload, client_pubkey))
			json = decrypt (payload, govern8r_privkey)

Server to Client:
	1. Create json payload: 
		payload = {....} 
	2. Encrypt payload with client's public key: 
		ciphertext = encrypt(payload, client_pubkey)
	3. Sign encrypted payload with govern8r's private key: 
		signature = sign(ciphertext, govern8r_privkey)
	4. Create payload with signature and ciphertext:
		payload = 
		{
			signature: "", ##  the signature from step 3
			message: "" ## the ciphertext from step 2
		}
	5. Send this as the REST response payload.
	6. Client will verify the message with the signature and if valid, then the server will decrypt it using its private key:
		if (verify(payload, govern8r_pubkey))
			json = decrypt (payload, client_privkey)


Authentication protocol (inspired by BitID)

This probably should be done using JSON Web Tokens. That said, this is simple enough. And it is only for GETs

1. Registered client requests a challenge:
	a. /govern8r/api/v1/challenge/<address> (GET)
2. If server detects that the client hasn't successfully registered, the authentication fails
3. If client is registered, the server:
	a. Generates a nonce and stores it in the DB for that client.
	b. Challenges: sends the nonce back to the client (in signed, encrypted payload)
4. Client responds to challenge:
	a. verifies signature
	b. decrypts payload
	c. signs nonce
	d. creates new payload, signs and encrypts it
	e. /govern8r/api/v1/challenge/<address> (PUT)
5. Server authenticates challenge assertion
	a. verifies signature
	b. decrypts payload
	c. checks nonce signature
	d. checks nonce still exists in DB
	e. constructs client fingerprint (user agent + ???)
	f. govern8r_token = hash(hash(fingerprint) + hash(nonce))
	g. set response cookie: govern8r_token
6. Client sends authentication token to server - client address is included in URI:
	a. Server constructs client fingerprint (user agent + ???)
	b. Server retrieves nonce associated with client address
	c. Server computes hash(hash(fingerprint) + hash(nonce))
	d. If govern8r_token cookie matches the hash, user is authenticated...
	e. authentication token is regenerated after every auth... token rotation! Client must take
	   care to store the cookie each time.
