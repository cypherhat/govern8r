Digital Notary: Design Details (tables)

We are gonna use DynamoDB - Amazon's document database (think mongoDB). 

We need 2 tables:

Account
	address 
	email
	nonce
	status
	date_created

Notarization
	Dublin Core metadata (15)
		title
		creator
		subject
		description
		publisher
		contributor
		date
		type
		format
		identifier
		source
		language
		relation
		coverage
		rights
	address
	file_digest
	user_signature_on_file_digest
	generated_meta_data
	notary_signature_on_meta_data
	transaction
	status
	date_created
	date_confirmed

We need Python code to do CRUD on these tables (boto3).

Meta Data defintion
   Meta data is a JSON data structure with these fields:
           User First Name:
           User Last  Name:
           Location       :
           File Digest    :
           User Public Address:  ?? Public Key/Public Address
           User Signature :
           Date in GMT    :
           Document Title :


           The above will be signed by notarizer. And a JSON will be created
           Meta Data:
           Notarizer Public Address:  ?? Public Key/Public Address
           Meta Data Signature :

?? One problem with public Address is third party can't verify the signature without public key.
Do we want third party to verify without the help of notarizer/end_user/ not?
