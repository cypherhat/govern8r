# govern8r

This is the repo for the govern8r setup script.

## Environment setup

Unfortunately, for right now we need to use python 2.7.11.

Install virtualenv for both client and server. 
```
virtualenv -p <path-to-python-2.7.11> govern8rClient
virtualenv -p <path-to-python-2.7.11> govern8rService
virtualenv -p <path-to-python-2.7.11> govern8rLib
```
